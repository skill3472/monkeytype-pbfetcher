## PBFetcher for Monkeytype
Made with ❤️ by skill3472


**This is a python script that fetches your Personal Best from [Monkeytype](monkeytype.com), and puts it in a text file.**
**An example use case would be editing your Github README to reflect your current PB.**

## Getting an API key
To get a monkeytype API key visit your [monkeytype settings](https://monkeytype.com/settings) and find the *ape keys* section, under *danger zone*. Generate one, activate it with a tickbox that appears next to it and put it in a text file. Now, just enter the name of the text file you created into `config.yaml` and you're all set!
